# Finding_connexes_components_in_Facebook_graphs
This project is about finding connexes components in a large graphe. using pyspark and hadoop (Big Data)
# Project: 
the documentation & the explanation of all algorithmes and sources are in file Finding_connexes_components_in_Facebook_graphs. 
# requirments : 
you need to install : 
- Pycharm to run algorithmes in local envirement; 
- For large graphes you need to execute a AWS  calculatings machine, flow the steps in file : Hadoop-MR-Spark-on-AWS-viaRosettaHub_explications.pdf
# Links : 
to dowload the files in your AWS machine, links are in file Download&tesst.
# Results : 
The result of execution of these algorithmes is at file : Final_results_and_explanations.pdf
